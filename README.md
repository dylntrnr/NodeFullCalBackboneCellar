A Mashup of [BackboneJsAndFullCalendar](https://github.com/shinetech/BackboneJsAndFullCalendar), [fullcalendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/), [Node Cellar](http://nodecellar.coenraets.org/), and Backbone.js.
=================

Quick start

	clone repo
	npm install
	start mongodb
	node server.js
	
	go to localhost:3000

	Since I am just trying to get something working I mashed these together. The drag and drop feature currently isn't saving things correctly. But if you click on a date and create an even it should save to the database.
